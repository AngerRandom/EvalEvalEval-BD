This folder consists of evals that I have got in a span of a few months that I put in their respective categories.

**If you think an eval is in the wrong category or you want to add an eval, ping me in the Ballsdex Developers server (tag is ihailthenight1234).**
If you don't know how to use the eval command, click [here](https://github.com/ContestedWheel/EvalEvalEval-BD/wiki/How-to-run-eval-commands-on-versions-2.25-and-above#how-to-run-the-eval-command)

The rest of this README will be giving a short description on what each eval does.
