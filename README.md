This is a repo for evals and custom commands that various people in the community have made for Ballsdex.

As Custom Commands are a little bit more on the advanced side, I have created some tutorials that will try to help beginners. Click "Wiki" or [click this blue text.](https://github.com/ContestedWheel/EvalEvalEval-BD/wiki) to access them.
If you don't want to touch code or not ready for adding custom stuff yet, I suggest you steer away from the Custom Commands part until you are ready.
Evals are a bit easier because it is just copying and pasting text, but if you are ever confused I always suggest joining the Discord server for help.

## Discord server

## Sources

The `/inspect` and the improved `/rarity` command is from CarFigures (repo has been deleted) and has been converted to Ballsdex by me.

The `/leaderboard` command is made by wascertified, which you can find [here](https://codeberg.org/wascertified/custom-cogs)

The classic `/rarity` command is made by GamingadlerHD. The repo still exists however the command itself has been deleted for some reason so I won't be linking it here.

All evals are taken from different public Discord servers and have been archived by me.
