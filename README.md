## Sources

The `/inspect` and the improved `/rarity` command is from CarFigures (repo has been deleted) and has been converted to Ballsdex by me.

The `/leaderboard` command is made by wascertified, which you can find [here](https://codeberg.org/wascertified/custom-cogs)

The classic `/rarity` command is made by GamingadlerHD. The repo still exists however the command itself has been deleted for some reason so I won't be linking it here.

All evals are taken from different public Discord servers and have been archived by me.
